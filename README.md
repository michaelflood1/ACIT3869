## Week 1

introduction everyone get in a circle and jerk

## week 2 Benchmarking

**why**

1. Comparing 
    - Allows you to compare different algorithms solving one problem for criteria such as speed, memory etc
2. Lets you identify weakpoints in your own code

**what**
1. Time
    - Big O notatation.
        - represents behaviour of the algorithm as input increases.
2. space
    - memory usage efficiency

**how**

1. Empirical
    - process of running algs on a set of test inputs measuring time and space
2. Theoretical
    - use Big-O notation to predict the performance for best, worst, average case. done before running code

### useful tools

python - time module
